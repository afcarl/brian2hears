Introduction
============

This library provides the Brian 2 counterpart of the brian.hears module in Brian 1.x. 

I have only started to port a very limited set of functions from the previous package, but it is on its way.
The most important object that has been implemented is the LinearFilterbankGroup, which provides a good starting point for simple auditory models.

Much of the syntax of the previous module will be retained, despite being briantwoed as per necessary.
